# RSS Sniffer
This script reads RSS feeds containing the latest additions to movie websites. The purpose of this is to scan various movie websites for new content of interest, eg the latest episode of a certain TV-serie. When the script is run all the feature titles are checked against a local database table. If the title is already in the table it is considered old content and discarded. If the title is not in the database table it is added to the database table and considered new content. After all RSS feeds are read user data is read. Each user has a list of titles to search for and an email address stored. Each user's list is checked against new content in the database table. The new content that matches the user's list is sent in an email to the user. This script is intended to be run about once an hour as a cron job.
